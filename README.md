an attempt at recreating Turing Machine and its corresponding DFA using graphs.

first CLA for the TuringMachine main is the size of the tape, second is the number of states.

first CLA for the DFA main is the number of states

following is the input for a turing machinie that accepts all strings in the language L={0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n+1</sup> | n>=0}
```
no
0br1
done
no
00r1
11r2
done
no
11r2
bbl3

no
11l4
00l5
bbr6

no
00l5
bbr0
